This is a work-in-progress repo of the upcoming command-line messaging app.

Eventually a user will be able to npm install this project, and start their own instance of the app. 
- Message history should be available only within the running session
- A user should be able to store contacts

#TODO
- [ ]  create a config file upon module installation that would require from user:
  - twilio authentication
  - twilio number
- [ ] create an api for a user to access -- probably one that would store contacts etc
